We're now up to half way through chapter 11.  

Next session we'll continue to practice with Applicative Functors.  We should understand:
 * the `<*>` implementation for `[]`, `((->) a)` and `IO` 
 * the Applicative Laws
 * why `<$>` exists

In order that we have a practical coding task to work on, I suggest we:
  * verify the Applicative Laws for various library types by writing property tests for them using QuickCheck.
  * verify the Applicative Laws for the Tuple type we defined a few sessions ago
