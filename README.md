============

The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Read http://learnyouahaskell.com/

Homework Schedule:

- Week 0 (10 Dec)
Read Chapters 1, 2 + 3 of http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters by next class - *Monday 17 December*

- Week 1 (17 Dec)
Read 4 and 5 of http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters by next session, which will be on *Monday 3 January*

Also, for the next session, we change the format as follows: we announce the problem to be solved ahead of the meeting, everyone has a go at it beforehand, and then we all solve it dojo-style during the session.

Next session's problem will be:

- Countdown numbers game.  Given a list of 6 integers and a 7th integer, find a way of inserting the arithmetic operators between the elements of the list such that when the resulting expression is evaluated, the result is the 7th integer.  E.g. given [1,2,5,8,9,25] and 272, a solution is 25×(5+2+1)+8×9.  (This problem is a special case of problem 93 of 99 problems: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions/90_to_94)
