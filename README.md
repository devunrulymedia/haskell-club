Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand Î± (alpha).  
 - In Strand "Advanced", we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand "Beginners", we are on chapter 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

on 31st Mar, **Strand "Advanced"** carried on with chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We looked at the Monad laws, and we now understand them in terms of Kleisli arrows.

on 24th Mar, **Strand "Beginners"** carried on with chapter 2, looking at lists. Homework is:
  - read on through chapter 2
  - write a fizzBuzz function, using a list comprehension, or by other means
