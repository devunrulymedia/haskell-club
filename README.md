============

The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Read http://learnyouahaskell.com/


    tl;dr; Come and learn Haskell on Thursdays, even (and especially) if you're new to ProDev, or coding, or functional programming.

    Every 2nd Thursday lunchtime, we'll be studying our book: "Learn you a Haskell for Great Good".  http://learnyouahaskell.com/   We usually look at some sections of the book together, and work (in pairs, or as a whole group) on some of the exercises: https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises

    So come along, especially if you've never done any Haskell, or any kind of functional programming, before.  It's a whole new world.

    In addition, we'll be carrying on with the work we've been doing trying to build a real application in Haskell.  There are 2 strands, operating on alternate Thursdays.  Come to one, or both:

        Learn You a Haskell Strand - every 2 weeks, from Thursday 17th May
        Build an Application Strand - every 2 weeks, from Thursday 24th May

    It's in All The Things, at lunchtime.  Bring your lunch, and we usually get started at about 13:15.  And do join #haskell on slack.
