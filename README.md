The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Haskell club runs 2 strands called Strand "Advanced" and Strand "Beginners".  Which one happens on a given week depends primarily on who turns up.  (We seem to have dropped the idea of alternating weeks.)
 - In Strand "Advanced", we are looking at various topics raised by building a simple EDSL
 - In Strand "Beginners", we are somewhere betweeen chapters 2 and 7 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), so scope for people of any level to join us!

on 28th July, we added a type checking evaluation function to our arithmetic EDSL.

on 4th Aug, we worked on understanding monadic composition, and hence ```do``` notation, via the [birdman example in chapter](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads#walk-the-line).  **Homework** is to express a sequence of ```landLeft``` and ```landRight``` in ```do``` notation.
