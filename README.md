The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand α (alpha).  
 - In Strand a, we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand α, we are on chapter 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

on 3rd Feb, **Strand a** started on chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We revised our study of the Functor and Applicative typeclasses, and studied Monad.  Our homework is to:
 - revise [our Either implementation](https://github.com/devunrulymedia/haskell-club/blob/master/code/2016-09-23/functors.hs), which is an instance of Applicative, and extend it to implement Monad. 
 - In the session we discussed extending our Maybe implementation to implement Monad.  It turns out that there is no such thing.  Create a Maybe type which implements Monad.

Today, 10th Feb, **Strand α** started at the beginning.  We experimented with arithmetic, boolean and some standard numerical functions in the REPL.  We learned about prefix and infix position for functions, and we wrote our own functions in a file which we then loaded into the repl.  Our homework is
  - revise chapter 1 and read chapter 2 up to "An intro to lists" (i.e. don't read "Texas Ranges" (unless you really want to))
  - write a function to take 3 numerical arguments, and return the minimum of them
