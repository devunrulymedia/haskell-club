We've finished chapter 11, and are about to start chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads" 

But...

we're practising what we've learned by doing some problem solving excercies

Sometimes we take a diversion through [99 questions in Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions) 

Today we took a look at some simple list operations: `length` and `take`, and how to write them from scratch, just using recursion and pattern matching.

**Homework** 
- Make sure that `take` does something sensible with a negative numerical argument.  You'll probably need to learn about [guards](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions#guards-guards)
- Write `reverse` for lists.


**Stretch Homework** Can you re-write `length`, `take` and `reverse` using a fold?
