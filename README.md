haskell-club
============

The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Read http://learnyouahaskell.com/

Homework Schedule:

- Week 0 (10 Dec)
Read Chapters 1, 2 + 3 of http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters by next class - *Monday 17 December*

- Week 1 (17 Dec)
Read 4 and 5 of http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters by next session, which will be on *Monday 3 January*

Also, for the next session, we change the format as follows: we announce the problem to be solved ahead of the meeting, everyone has a go at it beforehand, and then we all solve it dojo-style during the session.

Next sessions problem is not chosen yet!  It will be one of the following (add your suggestions, please...)
	-	implement a Xsort, where X is in Quick, Merge, Bubble, Heap, Shell, Bogo... (but QuickSort is the example in Learn You A Haskell, so maybe not that.)  See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo for MergeSort expressed through the medium of Transylvanian-saxon folk dance.
