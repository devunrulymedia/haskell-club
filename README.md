Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand Î± (alpha).  
 - In Strand "Advanced", we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand "Beginners", we are on chapter 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

on 31st Mar, **Strand "Advanced"** carried on with chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We looked at the Monad laws, and we now understand them in terms of Kleisli arrows.

on 5th May, **Strand "Beginners"** went a bit all over the shop, looking at tuples, datatypes, and pattern matching on them. No homework was set.
