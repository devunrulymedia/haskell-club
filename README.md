Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand Î± (alpha).  
 - In Strand "Advanced", we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand "Beginners", we are somewhere betweeen chapters 2 and 7 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), so scope for people of any level to join us!

on 31st Mar, **Strand "Advanced"** carried on with chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We looked at the Monad laws, and we now understand them in terms of Kleisli arrows.

on 23rd Jun, **Strand "Beginners"** worked on [99 problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions) problem 9.  We got as far as creating a version of `pack` which returns the repeating elements from the start of a list.  Homework exercise is to finish problem 9.
