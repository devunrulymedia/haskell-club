Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand α (alpha).  
 - In Strand a, we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand α, we are on chapter 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

on 17rd Feb, **Strand a** carried on with chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We made Monad instances of various data types.  We looked at the monad laws, at do notation, and at Kleisli Arrows.  Homework is to be able to adequately explain these things during the next session.

Today, 24th Feb, **Strand α** carried on with chapter 2, looking at lists. Homework is:
  - read on through chapter 2
  - write a function that takes a list of numbers (or just list of Int) and returns the sum of the members of the list
