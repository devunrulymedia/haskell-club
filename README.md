The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand α (alpha).  
 - In Strand a, we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand α, we are on chapter 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

on 3rd Feb, **Strand a** started on chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We revised our study of the Functor and Applicative typeclasses, and studied Monad.  Our homework is to:
 - revise [our Either implementation](https://github.com/devunrulymedia/haskell-club/blob/master/code/2016-09-23/functors.hs), which is an instance of Applicative, and extend it to implement Monad. 
 - In the session we discussed extending our Maybe implementation to implement Monad.  It turns out that there is no such thing.  Create a Maybe type which implements Monad.

Today, 24th Feb, **Strand α** carried on with chapter 2, looking at lists. Homework is:
  - read on through chapter 2
  - write a function that takes a list of numbers (or just list of Int) and returns the sum of the members of the list
