Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand "Advanced" and Strand "Beginners".  
 - In Strand "Advanced", we are on chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand "Beginners", we are somewhere betweeen chapters 2 and 7 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), so scope for people of any level to join us!

on 31st Mar, **Strand "Advanced"** carried on with chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We looked at the Monad laws, and we now understand them in terms of Kleisli arrows.

on 7th Jul, **Strand "Beginners"** worked on [99 problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions) problem 10 and 11.  We created a direct solution for encode (i.e. not using pack from problem 9) and for decode.  Since encode and decode composed should be the identity function, we played with using QuickCheck to test that this property did indeed hold.  We also broke our implementation of encode in various ways to explore how well QuickCheck would find the breakage.
