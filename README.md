The first Rule of Haskell Club is.....

Haskell club runs 2 strands, on alternate weeks, called Strand a and Strand α (alpha).  
 - In Strand a, we will pick up from chapter 12 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
 - In Strand α, we will study, or revise, from the start of the book

Today, 3rd Feb, **Strand a** started on chapter 12 "A Fistful of Monads".  We revised our study of the Functor and Applicative typeclasses, and studied Monad.  Our homework is to:
 - revise [our Either implementation](https://github.com/devunrulymedia/haskell-club/blob/master/code/2016-09-23/functors.hs), which is an instance of Applicative, and extend it to implement Monad. 
 - In the session we discussed extending our Maybe implementation to implement Monad.  It turns out that there is no such thing.  Create a Maybe type which implements Monad.

Next friday, 10th Feb, **Strand α** will start at the beginning.  Try to become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 of [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) if you're not already.
