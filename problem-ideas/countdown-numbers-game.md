Countdown numbers game
======================

- Countdown numbers game.  Given a list of 6 integers and a 7th integer, find a way of inserting the arithmetic operators between the elements of the list such that when the resulting expression is evaluated, the result is the 7th integer.  E.g. given [1,2,5,8,9,25] and 272, a solution is 25×(5+2+1)+8×9.  This problem is a special case of problem 93 of 99 problems: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions/90_to_94
