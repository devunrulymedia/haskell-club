chess board problem
===================

- Chess board problem.  Given an NxM chess board, and a collection of standard chess pieces, enumerate the ways in which the pieces can be placed on the board such that no piece is in a position to take another.  Ignore the colour of the pieces, and do not include pawns in the collection.  E.g. for input N=3, M=3, collection of 2 kings and 1 rook, the output is:

```
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
|K| |K|    |K| | |
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
| | | |    | | |R|
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
| |R| |    |K| | |
+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+
```

Any representation of the output is acceptable; ASCII-art is not required (or even encouraged...)
